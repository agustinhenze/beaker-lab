Beaker Lab Instance
===================

A docker compose for setting up a beaker server instance... I'm not going to
explain much more for now. It's higly experimental and I just understand the
10% of the infrastructer so... Use it under your own risk.
You need to have installed docker and docker-compose and then type down the
following command:

    $ docker-compose up

And then browse http://localhost:8000 where you can see the beaker server
running. The username is `admin` and the password is `testing`, good luck!
